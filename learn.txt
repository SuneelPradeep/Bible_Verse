 dynamo db is  nosql aws db and we are using schema.graphql we made to add the items
 in that db and we have AWS datestring we need to generate to place it in createdAt, updatedAt

 IN the frontend for the verses generated we need something called dynoamodb appsync so that it fetches data from it

 so we need to have interface as this is TS and we need to add interface then it will have values so TS wont giveerrors 

 in dynoamodb json we have for eg in normal json we have  "name" : "sunee" but in dynoamodbjson we have "name" :{ "S" : "suneel" } which means the name becomes its own object

interface is code we explain what are the different data types what the id would be ,we need to define those so typescript will understand

thank god ,for many months i have faced this issue which is gap at json of createdAt
 in the dynoamodb, so now solved it and moving forward will complete it soon as
  almost all the ui is done only connecting to amplify is left

 # to get our bloburl from lambda we have function in amplify functions src index.js and then it does
  pass in data or json into event or batch processing inside lambda ,generate code 
  serverless scripts our wish , returning us a response to user (us) body ,base64 encoded string
  
 #  so its nice to work the script in serverless and we have code already but we cant directly add our nodejs code into this , we need to add it 
 then also update the quotesgenerated +1
 to speak to dynamo we need to "amplify update function " in terminal to give it access or resource sharing to read and update the db 

 so after updating the tables names are already created for us so no need to hard code the data 
 we didnt install aws-sdk but aws knows so its fine its baked in  but aws-sdk-clients or soenthing like taht wont work
